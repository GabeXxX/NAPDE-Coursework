    "The idea behind finite difference relies approximating the partial derivatives that are present in the PDE by the incremental ratios computed on a suitable grid. The first step therefore consist of introducing computational grid. Assume for semplicity thta $\\Omega$ is the rectangle $(a,b) \\times (c,d)$. Let us introduce a partition $[a,b]$ in subintervals $(x_k, x_{k+1})$ for $k=0, \\dots, N_x$, with $x_0=a$ and $x_{N_x +1} = b$. Let us denote by $\\Delta_x = {x_0,\\dots, x_{N_x+1}}$ the set of end-points of such intervals and by $h_x = max (x_{k+1} - x_k)$ their maximum length.\n",
    "In the similar way we introduce a discretization of the y-axis $\\Delta_y = {y_0,\\dots, y_{N_y+1}}$ with $y_0=c$ and $y_{N_y +1} = d$. The cartesian product $\\Delta_h = \\Delta_x \\times \\Delta_y$ provides the computational grid on $\\Omega$ and $h=max \\{ h_x,h_y \\}$ is the charactersitic measure of the grid-size. We are looking for values $u_{i,j}$ which approximate $u(x_i, y_j)$. We will assume for semplicity that the nodes be uniformly spaced. In the case of function of two varibles, the second order derivative is approximated by the following incremental ratios:\n",
